# Jason Hallen
This is where I'll build a static website in GitHub Pages. I'll try to replicate my current website at [www.jasonhallen.com](www.jasonhallen.com) built with Joomla.

## Rationale
* My website is very simple.  Joomla is overkill.
* Joomla is very complicated. It takes a long time to figure out how to modify it for my needs.  Feels like I've just hacked it into shape without understanding it.
* Building my own simple static site generator will let me understand it inside and out.
* This project will help me understand Node.js, GitHub Pages, and aspects of deploying a website better.
* Hosting on GitHub Pages is free, so I could consider canceling BlueHost subscription.

## Tasks
- [ ] Fork Teeny into my GitHub
- [ ] NPM install fork of Teeny
- [ ] Init Teeny
- [ ] Build Teeny
- [ ] Deploy to `gh-pages` branch
- [ ] Configure "Pages" to deploy from `gh-pages` branch
