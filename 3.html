<p>Six months ago when I started to learn Csound I struggled to wrap my head around what exactly it was and what people were doing with it. At the most basic level I knew it could be used to make strange sounds, but even after I read online documentation, read the first chapters of Csound textbooks, and watched YouTube videos, I still had unanswered questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>How many people are using Csound?</li>
<li>What are they doing with it?</li>
<li>Where can you find it under the hood in software/hardware applications?</li>
<li>Is this a ubiquitous language in the music world, or is it an obscure language only used by a cultish group of practioners?</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve learned that I can’t predict where my curiosity will lead me or what obsessions will take hold of me. For instance, six months ago I did not suspect I would soon be devoting most of my time to learning Csound, a computer programming language for music, and yet today I do just that. This is all the more surprising given that six months ago I knew nothing about computer programming.</p>
