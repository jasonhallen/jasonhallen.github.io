## Tribute: Darwin Grosse

[INTRO IMAGE]

Darwin Grosse, a brilliant musician, software engineer, and podcaster, as well as a devoted husband, father, and friend, passed away on June 5th.  He had been battling cancer for a year or so.  You might not know his name, but if you've been in the world of electronic and computer music there's a good chance he's impacted your life.  He certainly impacted my life in a way that still stuns me when I think about it.

### Art, Music, and Technology
I first became aware of Darwin through his podcast, *[Art, Music, and Technology](LINK)*.  When I first began learning Csound in the spring of 2019 I wanted to find a podcast that could give me more perspective on computer music.  Surprisingly, I couldn't find many.  There seemed to be a number of podcasts about modular synthesis but far fewer about coding music.  In fact, *Art, Music, and Technology* was the only one I could find that regularly touched on that subject.

So I began listening to Darwin's back catalog.  The structure of the show was simple.  In each episode Darwin interviews someone involved in electronic music.  Guests seemed to be split about half from the synthesis world and half from the coding world.  Highlights included Miller Puckette, William Fields [OTHER HIGHLIGHTS].  Darwin always asked how the guest got involved in electronic music.  He had a knack for getting at the creative process.  It was always a stimulating podcast.
