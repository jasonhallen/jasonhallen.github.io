I code music.  My past musical endeavors were somewhat more traditional: writing songs, playing guitar, experimenting with synths, pedals, and feedback loops.  This culminated in my band Battle Napkin, now defunct.  After a few years of not making much music I stumbled upon Csound, a computer programming language for music.  The learning curve has been steep, but the possibilities are intoxicating.  This site documents my delving into the world of computer music.  I'm based out of Northfield, Minnesota.
