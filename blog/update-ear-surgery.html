<p>It's been an eventful couple weeks.  I got an ear surgery and rebuilt my website from the ground up.</p>

<h3 id="ear-surgery">Ear Surgery</h3>
<p>I mentioned my ear issues <a href="/blog/update-the-past-year">in a recent post</a>.  A quick recap is that earlier this year my right ear began to get severely fatigued after band practices.  Wearing ear protection didn't help.  The symptoms included ear pressure, hearing diminishment, and headaches. It became disorienting and stressful for me, which led me to the Mayo Clinic's Ear, Nose, and Throat department in Rochester, Minnesota.  But there's a bigger picture here.</p>
<h4 id="childhood-history">Childhood History</h4>
<p>As a young child I was prone to ear infections, and I had to have a few ear tubes installed.  This resulted in deformations of the bones of my right middle ear.  If you're not familiar, those three bones (the "osicles") conduct sound from your eardrum into your inner ear.  When the bones are deformed, they don't conduct sound as well.  That's how I ended up with poor hearing in my right ear.</p>
<p>I had two surgeries as a child to try to improve the sound conduction in my middle ear, but neither were successful.  For the past 25 years I've learned to live with this.  In fact, it's all I've ever really known.  It was just normal for me.  Fortunately, my left ear has always had great hearing.  Here's took at Mayo this spring.  You can see the left ear hears great while the right ear has moderately severe hearing loss.</p>
<p><img src="" alt="Hearing chart"></p>
<h4 id="the-doctors-opinion">The Doctor's Opinion</h4>
<p>At Mayo they gave me an audiology test and took a CT scan of my right ear.  I then met with Dr. Driscoll, a surgeon who specializes in middle ear hearing loss.  Here's what he told me:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We have two kinds of hearing: 1) the sound that travels through our eardrum, middle ear, and into the inner ear and 2) the sound that travels through our skull and into our inner ear.  While I have impairment in the first kind of hearing, I have nearly perfect bone conduction hearing.  That proves that most of my hearing loss is due to my middle ears.  This is actually promising because surgery can help restore natural hearing in that case.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The CT scan suggested that one of my osicles had gotten fused to a nearby structural bone.  In order to conduct sound well, the oscicles need to vibrate freely.  If one of them is fused to something else the vibration energy coming into the middle ear gets diffused before it makes it to the inner ear.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Dr. Driscoll said all signs indicate that a surgery on my middle ear could make a big difference in my hearing.  Interestingly, he pointed out that there was already a piece of wire in my ear from the last surgery when I was a child.  He took a picture of it.  I guess my oscicles were so deformed that the previous surgeon attempted to bypass them by running a wire directly from my eardrum to the base of the inner ear, or something like that.</p>
<p><img src="" alt="Eardrum"></p>
<h4 id="surgery-day">Surgery Day</h4>
<p>So on Thursday, July 28 I went in for surgery.  Technically, the procedure was called a "tympanoplasty" or "stapedectomy".  I was very anxious about it.  While the prospects looked good, there were still some risks like making my hearing worse, making my right ear deaf, and even highly unlikely but possible things like reducing my sense of smell or impairing my facial movements.  I went for it anyway.  I was hopeful that not only would my hearing improve but the troubling fatigue issues I experienced earlier in the year would be decreased.</p>
<p>All the staff at Mayo were incredible.  They put me at ease, and every step of the way they communicated clearly what was going to happen.  I laid on the medical bed as they wheeled me into the operating room.  From my vantage point staring up at the ceiling I caught glimpse of the bright room with the advanced medical equipment, and I was overcome with gratitude for the advancements in technology and medicine.  I was relieved to finally see Dr. Driscoll by my side.  He said, "It's good to see you, Jason!  I'm going to do my best not to make things worse.  I'm going to try to make them better!" He spoke to the heart of what I feared, and it comforted me.  Within a couple minutes I was asleep from the anesthesia.</p>
<p>A couple hours later I slowly woke up.  Kallie was there.  I was having a long personal conversation with the nurse, most of which I don't remember.  I was sipping on a cup of ice water and eating gold fish crackers.  Dr. Driscoll came in and said the surgery went exactly as planned.  They freed up one of my oscicles from the nearby structural bone.  In addition, they grafted a piece of cartiledge between my eardrum and the metal wire.</p>
<p><img src="" alt="Me in hospital"></p>
<p>The fog of anesthesia was lifting after about 30 minutes, so it was time to go home.  I carefully sat into a wheelchair, and they wheeled me down to the entrance of the hospital where Kallie had brought the car.  I was still very woozy as Kallie drove us the hour home.  Needless to say, my right ear felt strange.  It felt pressurized, congested, and gelatenous, and I could hear all sorts of internal sounds like clicking, popping, and gushing.  It was unnerving but not surprising.  When I spoke I could hear my voice loudly inside of my head, like when you have a bad cold.</p>
<h4 id="initial-results">Initial Results</h4>
<p>When we got home I sat down in bed for a while to rest.  Overall, I felt pretty good.  The wooziness went away quickly.  I was mentally pretty sharp, and despite the discomfort in my ear I wasn't experiencing much pain at all.</p>
<p>Then I noticed something strange.  My right hand was resting on the bed spread, and I unthinkingly dragged my fingers across its surface, an action which I must have done thousands of times before.  But this time I </p>
<p>It was supposed to get worse before it gets better, but it was already better</p>

<li>Audiology test in three months</li>
<li>Peak hearing might not happen for at least a few months</li>
