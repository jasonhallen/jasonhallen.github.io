  Happy to find your blog and read about your adventures w/Csound and Python. I
  have been picking at the problem you talk through in this post - thanks for
  the clear articulation here, really saved me some time. I was heading down the
  metro route and will opt for scoreTime in the Csound API, as you did. I am
  sending notes to Csound via UDP with great results, though OSC works will too
  of course. Thanks again!
