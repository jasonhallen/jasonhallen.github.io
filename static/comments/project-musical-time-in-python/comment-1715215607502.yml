  I'm late to the party but you can simplify Solution #4 by using Python's
  built-in performance timer.  Use time.perf_counter() instead of time.time(). 
  The following changes to Solution #4 should give you an accurate click and
  eliminate the dependency on cs.scoreTime():


  ```
      time_clock = 0
      while True:   # GUI event loop
          time_interval = 60/values['TEMPO']
          test_interval = time.perf_counter() - time_clock
          if test_interval >= time_interval:
              cs.sendScore("i 1 0 0.1")   # trigger note in Csound
              time_clock = time.perf_counter()
  ```


  I believe time.perf_counter() was introduced in Python 3.3.
