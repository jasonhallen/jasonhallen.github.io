  Hi Peter, thanks for chiming in! I really appreciate it. I'm glad this blog
  could be helpful for you. I've never used SuperCollider, SonicPi, or PureData
  but am aware of them.  If you want to get a sense for what's going on in the
  Csound world, I highly encourage you to register for the [Csound
  listserv](https://listserv.heanet.ie/cgi-bin/wa?A0=CSOUND).  Steven Yi (one of
  the Csound developers) also has a [cool blog](https://kunstmusik.com/)
  featuring his live coding in Csound.  Feel free to send me an email (found on
  my contact page) if you want to chat more about Csound and coding for music.

  Thanks for the Loscil and Four Tet recommendations.  I listened to a great
  interview with Scott Morgan of Loscil several months ago on Darwin Grosse's
  [Art + Music + Technology
  podcast](https://artmusictech.libsyn.com/podcast-303-scott-morgan-loscil). 
  That's a great podcast that covers coding in music and synthesis.  Sure
  enough, Scott named his project after the Csound opcode!

  Take care,
  Jason
