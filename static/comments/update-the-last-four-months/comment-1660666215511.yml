  Hey there! Just came across your blog while searching for info on csound. Very
  inspirational. I started dabbling with FoxDot earlier this year as my first
  foray into music programming. It's a python interface for Supercollider. I've
  not really taken it to heart - so thought I'd explore other possibilities.
  I've also tried out SonicPi and PureData. I end up sounding very "samey".


  I like your music list: I first came across Warp's output with their
  "Artificial Intelligence vol 2" collection back in the early 90s.


  Recently I've enjoyed Loscil (wonder where he got the name from!) and Four Tet
  (Kieran Hebden) - they may appeal to you as well.


  Right, you've inspired me to give Csound a whirl. Best wishes.
