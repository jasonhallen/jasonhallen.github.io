<p>In my last post I talked about <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=16:project-grammar-music&amp;catid=8:blog">generating a Csound score with Tracery</a>. That was a rewarding exercise, but Tracery isn't an ideal language to continue developing a music generator with. I decided to reimplement the music generator entirely in Python in order to take advantage of handy things like lists, conditional statements, functions, and classes. It all came together quicker than I expected, and I was even able to release an album of tracks showcasing the system.</p>

In this post I'll talk about using Tracery to generate Csound scores instead.</p>

<p>This fall I've been sitting in on a computer science course at Carleton called CS 318: Computational Media, taught by a visiting professor named <a href="https://www.jamesryan.world/">James Ryan</a>. This course focuses on new forms of creative expression and media that can only be made with computers. Examples include computer-generated poetry and novels, Twitter bots, computer-generated visual art, and virtual reality works.</p>

<h2 id="update-the-last-four-months"><a href="/blog/update-the-last-four-months.html">Update: The Last Four Months</a></h2><span class="muted">July 25, 2020</span>
<p>It’s been a while since my last post. Here’s an update on what I’ve been up to the last four months.</p>
<h3 id="not-doing-csound">Not Doing Csound</h3>
<p>I basically stopped working on my Csound projects when I started auditing a computer science course in March (see below). There were two reasons for taking this break from Csound.</p>
<ol>
<li>The computer science course took up most of my free time and brain space.</li>
<li>I had been going down the rabbit hole of frequency modulation (FM) synthesis and was getting overwhelmed. In particular, I was trying to emulate the Yamaha TX81Z synthesizer, which is what Mark Fell used on his <em>Multistability</em> album. However, emulating the TX81Z in Csound is not a simple project. I had gotten in over my head, so I took a little break. I've recently picked this project back up, and I hope to post about it soon.</li>

<figure><a href="/blog/study-mark-fell-rhythms"><img src="/images/electric_davis.png" alt="Electric Miles Davis"></a>

<p>I was drawn to the work of <a href="http://www.markfell.com/wiki/">Mark Fell</a> this past fall when I was exploring <a href="blog/project-drum-machine">rhythmic pattern generation</a> and FM synthesis. In particular, I was blown away by Fell’s collaboration with Gábor Lázár from 2015 called <em><a href="https://soundcloud.com/gaborlazar/mark-fell-and-gabor-lazar-the-neurobiology-of-moral-decision-making-2015">The Neurobiology of Moral Decision Making</a></em>.</p>
<p>I wanted to know how Fell and Lázár made these rhythms and sounds. A Google search landed me on <a href="https://llllllll.co/t/approaching-gabor-lazar-sound-design-techniques/13349">this thread in the lines forum</a> where I learned that Fell completed a PhD thesis in 2013 called <a href="http://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/804661/"><em>Works in Sound and Pattern Synthesis</em></a>. It turns out this thesis provides detailed discussions of Fell’s rhythmic pattern and synthesis algorithms. I decided to implement Fell’s ideas in Csound just like I did with <a href="blog/study-james-tenney">James Tenney’s ideas</a>.</p>

<p>I can’t remember why I decided to build a drum machine in Csound. After spending a few weeks on the <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=11:study-james-tenney&amp;catid=8:blog">James Tenney instrument</a>, which generates notes in a very randomized way, I must have been interested in generating notes within a metrical framework. In other words, I wanted to learn how to use the <code>metro</code> opcode.</p>
<p>But first, why would you build a drum machine when there are dozens of free, full-featured drum machines available online? Two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>You’ll learn a lot about Csound by building one yourself.</li>
<li>You can custom code the drum machine to do anything you’d like.</li>
</ol>
