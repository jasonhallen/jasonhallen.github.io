<p>And just <a href="/blog/update-the-past-year">when I wrote</a>, after a year’s absence from the blog, that I’m not doing computer music, I’ve suddenly been swept back into computer music in the past week. It’s Gábor Lázár’s fault. His new album <em>Boundary Object</em> on Planet Mu immediately gripped me and told me to get back to work.</p>

<p>And just like that a year has passed. In my <a href="/blog/project-looper">last post back in April of 2021</a>, I described a major coding project involving p5.js and Web Csound which culminated in a live performance. As I mentioned at the end of the post, I hit a coding wall immediately after this frenzy of activity. Then, just as I was beginning to take on my next music coding project, I met someone who derailed everything and sent me on a radically different musical path.</p>

<p>It's been a while! A lot has happened since my last post three months ago. After <a href="/blog/project-musical-time-in-python">finding an accurate time source in Python</a> I turned my attention to building a graphical user interface (GUI) for my Python music generator. That was moving along nicely, but then I discovered <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> and my focus shifted entirely. This led me to develop a new web-based program that loops audio files, and I was able to perform a live set with the program on YouTube. Read on for more details!</p>

<p>For the past couple weeks I've been wrestling with how to handle timing in Python. This was the main challenge I'd have to solve before converting my <a href="/blog/project-music-generator">Python music generator</a> into a real-time system. After experimenting with several possible solutions I finally found a promising one.</p>

<p>After five weeks of intensive coding I was able to release <a href="/blog/project-music-generator">an album of tracks</a> generated by my music system. This was a month ago. In the aftermath of this frenzy of creative activity a mild hopelessness set in. Even though I could see a thousand paths forward, I wasn't sure I was up to the task of continuing on. I wasn't sure where to direct my attention next. I think this is pretty normal after a bout of creative activity. Here were the paths forward I couldn't decide on.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep working on the music generator, including studying the history of music generators.</li>
<li>Delve into sound synthesis techniques.</li>
<li>Focus on studying general computer science.</li>
</ul>
<p>I ended up doing a little bit of all three over the past month. Here's what I've learned.</p>

<p>It's been a great year in listening to music for me. This is mostly due to the fact that I've been working from my home office, so I can play music on my stereo all day. Spotify was kind enough to tell me what albums I listened to most in 2020, so I thought I'd share them here along with some reflections. Writing up this blog post has given me a lot of gratitude for the listening experiences I was fortunate enough to have this year.</p>

<p>In my last post I talked about <a href="/blog/project-grammar-music">generating a Csound score with Tracery</a>. That was a rewarding exercise, but Tracery isn't an ideal language to continue developing a music generator with. I decided to reimplement the music generator entirely in Python in order to take advantage of handy things like lists, conditional statements, functions, and classes. It all came together quicker than I expected, and I was even able to release an album of tracks showcasing the system.</p>

<p>This fall I've been sitting in on a computer science course at Carleton called CS 318: Computational Media, taught by a visiting professor named <a href="https://www.jamesryan.world/">James Ryan</a>. This course focuses on new forms of creative expression and media that can only be made with computers. Examples include computer-generated poetry and novels, Twitter bots, computer-generated visual art, and virtual reality works.</p>

<h2 id="update-the-last-four-months"><a href="/blog/update-the-last-four-months">Update: The Last Four Months</a></h2><span class="muted date">July 25, 2020</span>
<p>It’s been a while since my last post. Here’s an update on what I’ve been up to the last four months.</p>
<h3 id="not-doing-csound">Not Doing Csound</h3>
<p>I basically stopped working on my Csound projects when I started auditing a computer science course in March (see below). There were two reasons for taking this break from Csound.</p>
<ol>
<li>The computer science course took up most of my free time and brain space.</li>
<li>I had been going down the rabbit hole of frequency modulation (FM) synthesis and was getting overwhelmed. In particular, I was trying to emulate the Yamaha TX81Z synthesizer, which is what Mark Fell used on his <em>Multistability</em> album. However, emulating the TX81Z in Csound is not a simple project. I had gotten in over my head, so I took a little break. I've recently picked this project back up, and I hope to post about it soon.</li>
</ol>
